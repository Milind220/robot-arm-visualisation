# 3-DOF Robot Arm visualization tool
The arm in question has two rotational degrees of freedom, and one translational degree of freedom.

## Visualization Usage
To try the visualization tool out, you need to run the [animate.py](https://github.com/Milind220/robot-arm-visualisation/edit/main/animate.py) file with the proper libraries installed. (matplotlib 3.0.3 supported).

You can then use keyboard controls: use x, y, z to select axes (x axis, y axis, z axis), and then the up and down buttons to increment the position of the target coordinate. If you click 'r' on your keyboard, it will reset the position.

## Demo
### Moving a point along the Z axis

### Moving a point along all axes one by one
